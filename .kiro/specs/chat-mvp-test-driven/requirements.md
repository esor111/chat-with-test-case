# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a minimal viable chat system backend using a strict test-first development approach. The system follows the Blue → Red → Green testing methodology where we start with skeleton tests that pass, then make them fail with real expectations, and finally implement the minimal code to make them pass. The focus is on user-visible outcomes without over-engineering, building only what tests demand.

The system will support basic 1-to-1 chat functionality with message persistence and real-time delivery using Nest.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Socket.io.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a list of my chats, so that I can navigate to conversations I want to continue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests their chat list THEN the system SHALL return a list of chat conversations
2. WHEN a chat list is displayed THEN each chat SHALL show the most recent message preview
3. WHEN a chat list is empty THEN the system SHALL return an empty array without errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to open a chat and see message history, so that I can review previous conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens a specific chat THEN the system SHALL display all previous messages in chronological order
2. WHEN a chat has no previous messages THEN the system SHALL display an empty message history
3. WHEN message history is loaded THEN each message SHALL include sender, content, and timestamp

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send a message and see it appear immediately, so that I get instant feedback that my message was sent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the message SHALL appear immediately in their chat interface
2. WHEN a message is sent THEN the system SHALL return a success status to the sender
3. WHEN a message fails to send THEN the system SHALL provide clear error feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my messages to persist across sessions, so that I don't lose my conversation history when I restart the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the message SHALL be stored in persistent storage
2. WHEN a user reopens a chat after restarting THEN all previous messages SHALL still be visible
3. WHEN the system restarts THEN no message data SHALL be lost

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a recipient, I want to receive messages in real-time, so that I can have fluid conversations without refreshing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is sent to a user THEN the recipient SHALL receive it immediately without page refresh
2. WHEN a user is offline THEN messages SHALL be queued for delivery when they come back online
3. WHEN real-time delivery fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to polling mechanisms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see read receipts, so that I know when my messages have been seen by the recipient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a recipient views a message THEN the sender SHALL see a read receipt indicator
2. WHEN a message is unread THEN it SHALL be clearly marked as unread for the recipient
3. WHEN multiple messages are read THEN read receipts SHALL update for all viewed messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want infrastructure setup to follow a specific test-driven sequence, so that each component is added only when needed and properly validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up infrastructure THEN it SHALL follow this exact order: Nest.js app → PostgreSQL → Redis → Socket.io
2. WHEN each infrastructure component is added THEN it SHALL have a skeleton test that passes before implementation
3. WHEN a skeleton test exists THEN it SHALL be converted to fail with real checks before adding the infrastructure
4. WHEN infrastructure tests fail THEN the minimal setup SHALL be implemented to make them pass
5. WHEN all infrastructure tests pass THEN an end-to-end smoke test SHALL validate the complete system

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage following Blue → Red → Green methodology, so that the system is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing any feature THEN it SHALL start with a skeleton test that passes (Blue phase)
2. WHEN a skeleton test exists THEN it SHALL be converted to a real test that fails (Red phase)  
3. WHEN a test fails THEN minimal code SHALL be implemented to make it pass (Green phase)
4. WHEN all tests pass THEN code SHALL be refactored without adding new functionality
5. WHEN adding infrastructure THEN it SHALL only be added when a specific test demands it

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend infrastructure components properly configured, so that the chat system has reliable persistence, caching, and real-time capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Nest.js application starts THEN it SHALL respond to health checks on /health endpoint
2. WHEN PostgreSQL is needed THEN it SHALL successfully execute SELECT 1 queries for connection validation
3. WHEN Redis is needed THEN it SHALL successfully respond to PING commands with PONG
4. WHEN Socket.io is needed THEN it SHALL accept client connections and handle ping-pong events
5. WHEN all infrastructure is ready THEN an end-to-end test SHALL send a message through the complete flow
