# Foundation Completion Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for completing the chat backend foundation by adding comprehensive test coverage for all missing functionality identified in the Phase 1 MVP requirements. The goal is to create a complete, battle-tested foundation with ~32 tests covering all core functionality before transforming to real implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Conversation Management Foundation

**User Story:** As a foundation validator, I want comprehensive conversation management tests, so that all conversation types and participant rules are validated before real implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a direct conversation THEN the system SHALL enforce exactly 2 participants
2. WHEN creating a group conversation THEN the system SHALL allow 2-8 participants maximum
3. WHEN attempting to create group with >8 participants THEN the system SHALL reject with appropriate error
4. WHEN attempting to create direct with â‰ 2 participants THEN the system SHALL reject with appropriate error
5. WHEN user joins existing group conversation THEN the system SHALL add them to participant list
6. WHEN user leaves group conversation THEN the system SHALL remove them from participant list
7. WHEN user attempts to join conversation twice THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully without duplication

### Requirement 2: Business Chat Workflow Foundation

**User Story:** As a foundation validator, I want business chat workflow tests, so that user-business communication patterns are validated before real implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user initiates business conversation THEN the system SHALL create conversation with user, business, and assigned agent
2. WHEN assigning agent to business conversation THEN the system SHALL use round-robin or least-busy algorithm
3. WHEN no agents are available THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with appropriate fallback
4. WHEN business responds to user message THEN the system SHALL route through assigned agent
5. WHEN business conversation is created THEN the system SHALL track business-specific metadata
6. WHEN agent becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL reassign conversation to available agent

### Requirement 3: Profile Integration Foundation

**User Story:** As a foundation validator, I want profile integration tests, so that kaha-main-v3 integration patterns are validated before real implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying conversation participants THEN the system SHALL fetch profiles in single batch API call
2. WHEN profiles are fetched THEN the system SHALL cache them in Redis for 6 hours
3. WHEN batch profile API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL serve cached profiles
4. WHEN profile update event is received THEN the system SHALL invalidate corresponding cache entries
5. WHEN batch API returns partial failures THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with available data
6. WHEN cache is empty and API fails THEN the system SHALL use fallback display (UUID or "Unknown User")

### Requirement 4: Presence Tracking Foundation

**User Story:** As a foundation validator, I want presence tracking tests, so that online/offline status management is validated before real implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user connects via WebSocket THEN the system SHALL mark them as online
2. WHEN user has no activity for 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL mark them as offline
3. WHEN user has multiple devices THEN the system SHALL track presence per device correctly
4. WHEN user presence changes THEN the system SHALL broadcast to conversation participants
5. WHEN server restarts THEN the system SHALL restore presence state from persistent storage
6. WHEN WebSocket disconnects unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL handle graceful offline transition

### Requirement 5: Unread Count Management Foundation

**User Story:** As a foundation validator, I want unread count tests, so that message read status tracking is validated before real implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new message is received THEN the system SHALL increment unread count for all conversation participants except sender
2. WHEN user reads messages THEN the system SHALL reset unread count for that conversation
3. WHEN tracking unread counts THEN the system SHALL maintain separate counts per conversation per user
4. WHEN user reads messages in group conversation THEN the system SHALL only reset count for that specific user
5. WHEN message is sent by user THEN the system SHALL not increment unread count for the sender
6. WHEN user joins existing conversation THEN the system SHALL calculate initial unread count correctly

### Requirement 6: Redis Caching Foundation

**User Story:** As a foundation validator, I want Redis caching tests, so that caching patterns are validated before real implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN caching profile data THEN the system SHALL use appropriate TTL (6 hours for profiles)
2. WHEN cache key expires THEN the system SHALL fetch fresh data from source
3. WHEN cache is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operation without caching
4. WHEN invalidating cache THEN the system SHALL remove specific keys without affecting others
5. WHEN storing presence data THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Redis data structures
6. WHEN cache memory is full THEN the system SHALL handle eviction gracefully

### Requirement 7: Advanced Message Management Foundation

**User Story:** As a foundation validator, I want advanced message management tests, so that complex messaging scenarios are validated before real implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN message contains mentions (@user) THEN the system SHALL parse and validate mentioned users
2. WHEN message is edited THEN the system SHALL track edit history and timestamps
3. WHEN message is deleted THEN the system SHALL soft delete with tombstone record
4. WHEN message contains links THEN the system SHALL validate and potentially generate previews
5. WHEN message is replied to THEN the system SHALL maintain thread/reply relationships
6. WHEN message fails to send THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanism with exponential backoff

### Requirement 8: Conversation Permissions Foundation

**User Story:** As a foundation validator, I want conversation permission tests, so that access control patterns are validated before real implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user accesses conversation THEN the system SHALL validate they are a participant
2. WHEN user attempts to add participant THEN the system SHALL validate they have permission
3. WHEN user attempts to remove participant THEN the system SHALL validate they have permission
4. WHEN business conversation is accessed THEN the system SHALL validate business-user relationship
5. WHEN agent accesses business conversation THEN the system SHALL validate agent assignment
6. WHEN conversation is archived THEN the system SHALL restrict access appropriately

### Requirement 9: Performance and Scalability Foundation

**User Story:** As a foundation validator, I want performance tests, so that scalability patterns are validated before real implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling concurrent message sending THEN the system SHALL maintain message ordering
2. WHEN processing batch profile requests THEN the system SHALL complete within acceptable time limits
3. WHEN managing WebSocket connections THEN the system SHALL handle connection limits gracefully
4. WHEN database is under load THEN the system SHALL maintain response times within SLA
5. WHEN Redis is under load THEN the system SHALL handle caching operations efficiently
6. WHEN system reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate backpressure mechanisms

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Recovery Foundation

**User Story:** As a foundation validator, I want comprehensive error handling tests, so that failure scenarios are validated before real implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external service (kaha-main-v3) is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operation with degraded functionality
2. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection with exponential backoff
3. WHEN Redis connection fails THEN the system SHALL continue operation without caching
4. WHEN WebSocket connection drops THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection gracefully
5. WHEN message delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry with appropriate strategy
6. WHEN system encounters unexpected errors THEN the system SHALL log appropriately and recover gracefully
